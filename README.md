face recognition on desktop webcam using face-api.js library

The project should be accompanied by your own database. In order to do so;

1. Create a folder named "labels" to accompany the folder "models".
2. Inside "labels", create folders of persons using their name. Eg. "labels/Messi".
3. Inside the person's folder, insert numbers of face images of the person. Rename the .png files using numbers. Eg. "labels/Messi/1.png"
4. Insert as many face images possible to increase the accuracy of recognition.
5. Lastly, in "script.js", insert the name into string varaible defined in "lables". "Iska --> [name according to folder]"
